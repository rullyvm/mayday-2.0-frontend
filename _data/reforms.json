  "descriptionLong": "In the 2014 election, Jim Rubens (NH) was the only Republican candidate for Senate to run a campaign focussed on a reform agenda. His proposal to reform the way elections are funded consists of three policy points:\n\n1. Enact a public elections finance system for candidates voluntarily opting out of the current corrupted private money system. Each two years, every legal voter is given a $50 tax rebate voucher assignable to and spendable only by candidates for Congress. Candidates eligible to receive vouchers must first establish credibility by having raised a threshold sum of private money in small dollar contributions from persons eligible to vote for the participating candidate. There is no requirement that candidates participate in the public system. If every voter used them (unlikely), the tax rebate vouchers would cost taxpayers about $4 billion per year, far less than the cost of the private system, where political money is traded for taxpayer-financed tax loopholes, pork, and regulatory and diplomatic favors. Unused vouchers expire worthless at the end of each cycle; voucher privacy and anti-fraud protections are required.\n2. Require searchable, realtime online reporting of contributions above $200 to every candidate and organization engaging in campaigning for or against candidates, legislation or regulatory activity. While disclosure can suppress paid speech, there is a stronger and offsetting public interest in knowing about real or perceivable conflicts of interest involving public money and the public trust.\n3. Remove all political spending and contribution limits. Attempts to limit private political spending have failed and the First Amendment protects the right of even wealthy and well-organized people to speak using as much money as they wish. Note: this must be coupled with a sufficiently funded public elections finance system.\n",
